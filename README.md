# Educational Project: HTML5, Responsive Design, SCSS, BEM, Pixel-Perfect Layout, File Organization

## Repository Description
In this educational project, I focused on implementing various technologies and methodologies while adhering to the following requirements:

- **HTML5 Tags**: I utilized HTML5 tags to create the structure and semantic markup of the web pages. This ensured proper semantic labeling of different content elements.

- **Responsive Design**: The website was designed to be responsive, adapting to various screen sizes as specified in the design mockup. Media queries and responsive techniques were employed to ensure optimal content display on different devices.

- **SCSS Preprocessor**: SCSS (Sass) preprocessor was used for styling the project. Leveraging features such as variables, mixins, and other Sass functionalities, it facilitated a more efficient and organized approach to writing CSS code.

- **BEM Methodology**: The BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) methodology was adopted for class naming conventions. This provided a clear and structured system for naming classes, promoting maintainability and scalability of styles.

- **Pixel-Perfect Layout**: Great attention was given to achieving a pixel-perfect layout, accurately reproducing the design mockup. Precise pixel values from the mockup were utilized to ensure exact alignment and spacing of elements.

- **File Organization**: All resources, including fonts, images, and styles, were organized into respective folders. This enhanced project structure and made file management more streamlined.

By incorporating these practices, the project successfully met the requirements of using HTML5 tags, implementing a responsive design, utilizing the SCSS preprocessor, applying the BEM methodology, achieving pixel-perfect layout, and organizing files.

Happy coding!
